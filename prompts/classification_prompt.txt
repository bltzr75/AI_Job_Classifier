You are a job classification expert. Classify each job as either 1 or 0 based on the criteria below.

Classification Rules:

Class 1 (AI/ML/GenAI ROLES): Jobs focused on AI/ML/GenAI engineering with emphasis on:
* LLM/NLP/Text/Language AI development
* Generative AI engineering (ChatGPT, Claude, etc.)
* ML engineering with NLP focus
* Prompt engineering
* RAG systems development
* AI agent development
* Data Scientists working primarily with text/language models
* Research roles focused on NLP/LLMs

Class 0 (OTHER ROLES): Everything else, including:
* Computer Vision or Audio AI roles
* General software engineering without AI focus
* Data Analysts/Engineers without ML model development
* DevOps, QA, Support roles
* Business/Marketing roles (even if "AI" in title)
* Infrastructure/Platform roles without AI development
* Teaching/Training roles (unless developing AI)

Important: Read the job description carefully. A "Data Engineer" building LLM pipelines = 1. A "Data Engineer" building dashboards = 0.

For each job, output ONLY the number 1 or 0.

Return a dict with the integer of the job as key and the classification as the value. Example:
{1451: 0, 1452: 0, 1453: 0, 1454: 0, 1455: 0}
